## Architecture Decisions

_Key decisions and rationale for this project:_

- 

## Code Patterns

_Patterns Claude should follow:_

- 

## Do NOT

- Don't modify dependencies without asking
- Don't commit directly; create PRs
- Don't ignore failing tests
- Don't skip documentation

## Memory

| Scope | Location |
|-------|----------|
| Project | `.agent/memory.md` |
| Global | `~/.agent-core/memory/global.md` |

## Parallel Sessions (Boris's Pattern)

```
Tab 1: Orchestrator (planning, merging)
Tab 2-3: Feature development
Tab 4: Testing
Tab 5: Documentation
```

**Protocol:**
1. Orchestrator plans and assigns
2. Workers execute in parallel
3. Each worker: `/sync push` when done
4. Orchestrator: `/sync pull`, merge, PR
