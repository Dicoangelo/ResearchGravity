## 9. Derived Principles

### Builder Identity
- **Create-first**: 24.7% of all intents are creation. You build before you research.
- **Deep work dominant**: 51.3% deep work mode. Not a casual AI user — a systematic builder.
- **Infrastructure mindset**: Top topics are AI agents + coding + DevOps + database = building systems.

### Temporal Sovereignty
- **3 AM is your 9 AM**: Peak cognitive output happens at 3:00 AM — 4.4x any other hour.
- **Night builder**: 33.4% of all cognitive events happen between 2-5 AM.
- **This is a feature, not a bug**: Your best work happens when the world is quiet.

### Cross-Platform Thinking
- **Distributed cognition**: 72 coherence moments prove ideas emerge independently across platforms.
- **Semantic echoes**: Same insights surface on ChatGPT and Grok without being copied.
- **Synchronicity**: Temporal alignment — you think about the same problem on multiple platforms simultaneously.

### Innovation Pattern
- **11K breakthrough signals**: 6.7% of all events flagged as having breakthrough potential.
- **15K excellent quality events**: Your cognitive output consistently produces high-quality artifacts.
- **7 active arcs**: Your thinking follows persistent threads that span platforms and weeks.
